###There is a list of Cars in the system, for which it is necessary to implement:
index.jsp /
login.jsp /login

- choice by brand;
- choice according to quality class;
- sort by rental price;
- sort by name.
  The customer registers in the system, chooses a car and makes a rental order. An
  unregistered customer cannot place an order. In the order data the client indicates passport
  data, option &#39;with driver&#39; / &#39;without driver&#39;, lease term. The system generates an Invoice,
  which the client pays.
  The manager reviews the order and may reject it, giving a reason. The manager also
  registers the return of the car, in case of car damage he issues an invoice for repairs through
  the system.
  The system administrator has the rights:
- adding, deleting cars, editing car information;
- blocking / unblocking- the user;
- registration of managers in the system.
